    "Drivers who didn't receive tips will probably be upset that the app told them a customer would leave a tip. If it happened often, drivers might not trust the app. Drivers are unlikely to pick up people who are predicted to not leave tips. Customers will have difficulty finding a taxi that will pick them up, and might get angry at the taxi company. Even when the model is correct, people who can't afford to tip will find it more difficult to get taxis, which limits the accessibility of taxi service to those who pay extra.\n",

    "Now fit the model to the training data. Note that, depending on how many options you include in your search grid and the number of cross-validation folds you select, this could take a very long time&mdash;even hours. If you use 4-fold validation and include only one possible value for each hyperparameter and grow 300 trees to full depth, it should take about 5 minutes. If you add another value for GridSearch to check for, say, `min_samples_split` (so all hyperparameters now have 1 value except for `min_samples_split`, which has 2 possibilities), it would double the time to ~10 minutes. Each additional parameter would approximately double the time. "

For our use case, this would be more desirable, because it's better for a driver to be pleasantly surprised by a generous tip when they weren't expecting one than to be disappointed by a low tip when they were expecting a generous one. However, it's unlikely that this model would be deployed without further development to significantly improve its performance."

    "In this step, use the results of the models above to formulate a conclusion. Consider the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Would you recommend using this model? Why or why not?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What was your model doing? Can you explain how it was making predictions?**   \n",

    "3. **Are there new features that you can engineer that might improve model performance?**   \n",

    "Remember, sometimes your data simply will not be predictive of your chosen target. This is common. Machine learning is a powerful tool, but it is not magic. If your data does not contain predictive signal, even the most complex algorithm will not be able to deliver consistent and accurate predictions. Do not be afraid to draw this conclusion. Even if you cannot use the model to make strong predictions, was the work done in vain? Consider any insights that you could report back to stakeholders."
