# Automatidata_Project

# 1 - Python
Welcome to the Automatidata Project!
You have just started as a data professional in a fictional data consulting firm, Automatidata. Their client, the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission
(New York City TLC), has hired the Automatidata team for its reputation in helping their clients develop data-based solutions.
The team is still in the early stages of the project. Previously, you were asked to complete a project proposal by your supervisor, DeShawn Washington.
You have received notice that your project proposal has been approved and that New York City TLC has given the Automatidata team access to their data.
To get clear insights, New York TLC's data must be analyzed, key variables identified, and the dataset ensured it is ready for analysis.

# 2 - Exploratory data analysis
You are the newest data professional in a fictional data consulting firm: Automatidata. The team is still early into the project, having only just completed
an initial plan of action and some early Python coding work.

Luana Rodriquez, the senior data analyst at Automatidata, is pleased with the work you have already completed and requests your assistance with some EDA and
data visualization work for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission project (New York City TLC) to get a general understanding of what taxi ridership
looks like. The management team is asking for a Python notebook showing data structuring and cleaning, as well as any matplotlib/seaborn visualizations plotted
to help understand the data. At the very least, include a box plot of the ride durations and some time series plots, like a breakdown by quarter or month.

Additionally, the management team has recently asked all EDA to include Tableau visualizations. For this taxi data, create a Tableau dashboard showing a New
York City map of taxi/limo trips by month. Make sure it is easy to understand to someone who isn’t data savvy, and remember that the assistant director at the
New York City TLC is a person with visual impairments.

# 3 - Statistic

You are a data professional in a data consulting firm, called Automatidata. The current project for their newest client, the New York City Taxi & Limousine
Commission (New York City TLC) is reaching its midpoint, having completed a project proposal, Python coding work, and exploratory data analysis.

You receive a new email from Uli King, Automatidata’s project manager. Uli tells your team about a new request from the New York City TLC: to analyze the
relationship between fare amount and payment type. A follow-up email from Luana includes your specific assignment: to conduct an A/B test.

# 4 - Regression Analysis
The data consulting firm Automatidata has recently hired you as the newest member of their data analytics team. Their newest client, the NYC Taxi and Limousine
Commission (New York City TLC), wants the Automatidata team to build a multiple linear regression model to predict taxi fares using existing data that was
collected over the course of a year. The team is getting closer to completing the project, having completed an initial plan of action, initial Python coding
work, EDA, and A/B testing.

The Automatidata team has reviewed the results of the A/B testing. Now it’s time to work on predicting the taxi fare amounts. You’ve impressed your Automatidata
colleagues with your hard work and attention to detail. The data team believes that you are ready to build the regression model and update the client New York
City TLC about your progress.

# 5 - Machine Learning
You are a data professional in a data analytics firm called Automatidata. Their client, the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (New York City TLC),
was impressed with the work you have done and has requested that you build a machine learning model to predict if a customer will not leave a tip.
They want to use the model in an app that will alert taxi drivers to customers who are unlikely to tip, since drivers depend on tips.
